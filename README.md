# Gene JBrowse Fields
This module attempts to create a field on Gene pages that will either be a link out to an already existing JBrowse instance or display one in an iframe within the page itself.

It is purely a learning module. Hopefully some of this work will eventually make its way into the Tripal JBrowse module

## Progress
 - [x] Get field, widget added
 - [ ] Get (any) data to show up in the field
 - [ ] Make links dynamically generated (possible to not have to read from DB each time?)
